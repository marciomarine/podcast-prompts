“Welcome to PodSec. I'm Kaiser, a public security consultant and information security specialist.
Today, we're going straight to the point about what's really happening in the digital underworld — from hackers to online casinos.
No excessive theory, no beating around the bush. Real security, as it is in the field.”

Most common flaws in companies, governments, and users.

Real-world cases (unnamed) of recent breaches.

Real investigation dynamics: how to reach the criminal.

Obstacles when the perpetrator is outside the country.

Real mini-case: cyber tracking operation.

Impactful statement:

Most common scams today: PIX (Brazilian instant payment system), cryptocurrencies, fake investments, romance scams, deepfakes.

How targets work and the psychological profile of victims.

“Quick checklist” for digital self-defense:

Be wary of urgency and emotion.

Verify the origin.

Confirm outside the message channel.

Impact of this on organized crime and the average citizen.
